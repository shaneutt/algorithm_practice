ShanesDijkstraTest
------------------

This is my Scala implementation of "Dijkstra's Algorithm" with some test cases.

requires
--------

Scala version 2.11.7 (OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.7.0_79)

I included a copy of the Scala I used under `scala-2.11.7/bin/scala`

(I built it with this setup, I'm sure it works with other versions)

usage
-----

You can bootstrap it like this:

	./build.sh

Which will generate the test class and you can run the tests with

	./runtests.sh
